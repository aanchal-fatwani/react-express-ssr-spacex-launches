## Technical Details

The project has been developed using React and Express. The data being utilized is being accessed and fetched through an API request which gives the list of launches along with their details up to a limit as requested by the user.

### API Endpoints

For initial loading of content; gives the entire list up to the limit <br/>
https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=100

For fetching successful launches <br/>
https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=100&launch_success=true

For fetching launches with successful landing <br/>
https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=100&land_success=true

For fetching launches corresponding to a particular year of launch <br/>

### Special features of the App

#### Responsive Behaviour
The app has been created by keeping in mind the variability of devices and system resources that can be used to access this, and hence the app supports great level of responsiveness.
<br/>
Responsive Behavior Details 
1. Mobile View: Page should have only one Column until 700 px. <br/>
2. Tablet View: Page should have 2 columns between 700 and 1024 px. <br/>
3. Desktop View: Page should have 4 columns between 1024 and 1440 px. Beyond 1440px viewport, the content will be centered align with a max width of 1440.

## Future Scope Of Improvement

The project can be extended through better handling of filter options and by adding more choices for users to request and explore.
<br/>
The project can add a layer of robustness by introducing testing methodologies at various stages. To start, custom test cases can be built to test sanity and corner edge cases.
